# Name ideas

* HackPool
* HackLiv

# Hackathon date

April / March since it gives us more time. Could potentially get change to October later on.

hackathon is 26 - 27 hours. 24 hours of hacking, 2 - 3 hours of presentations and prize giving.

# Hackathon sponsor ideas

Sponsor **must** provide a gift and an API to allow hackers to use.  They must provide a person at the hackathon during the day time to talk about the API who is experienced in it. That person would preferably be a judge. The company must try to sponsor us some money too, since this is a student led hackathon. In return, the company will generate new ideas for their company (Capital One made an Alexa app based off of a hackathon idea) and the company will receive many interested internship offers.

Don't be afraid to say **no** to a sponsor
