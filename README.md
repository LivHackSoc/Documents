# Introduction

We are University of Liverpool Hackathon society. Our current goal is to host an upcoming MLH 24-hours hackathon and host many programming events for any University's students to join.

The society has project boards, which are like Trello boards to keep track of to-do lists and other such nidbits.

This folder contains essential documents for the society.
