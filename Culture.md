# Vision

The dream is to create the Liverpool hacker community. Other universities and areas have great hacker communities. Manchester, Sheffield, Surrey.
We want the same for Liverpool.

Although this is a University of Liverpool society our prioroty is on creating the hacker community in Liverpool, ultimately
creating a legacy after the first commitee have left.

We need to communicate with local businesses, other universities and more to turn Liverpool into a hacker-friendly city.

# Values

* Never do it for the money. We are not in this for the money. We are here to create a community, not to generate profit.
* Everything is free - None of our events will cost a single dime. Everything will be free and accessible to everyone.
* We value dedication to the cause. We are building a community, not just something you can put on your CV. This will change Liverpool **forever**.
* We value hardwork but above all we value someone who can pace themselves. Do not work 24/7 on this society. Building a community is a marathon not a sprint.

# Customs

We communicate pubically in our Slack group. Information **needs** to be shared and free. We will not hide information from eachother via DMs.
We will aim to mainly use Slack as a forms of communication. Occasionally when we are all in the same room we can discuss this in person, but Slack is the main means of communciation.

We build a little every single day. Even if you only change the grammar on a sentence, build something every single day.
This is a marathon, not a sprint. We can't build this community by working 24/7 over a period of a week. We need to go slowly and be fast when we are required to be fast.

# Story

This section is dedicated to our story and features our milestones.

It started off in December when Brandon Skerritt (myself) and Yales decided that Liverpool needed a hacker community. After being rejected and finding others
who are passionate about the cause we decided to recreate the society.

We were jealous of what Manchester had and we wanted a hacker scene just like them.

## Milestones

### Community Website
When this is built write a story of:
- how it felt to build it
- who was there (who helped build it)
- any cool things that happened
- How long did it take
Just a cool little story.

### Hackathon Website

### Sponsor Prospectus

## Space

The work will be entirely remote and can be done 24/7. Discussions will take place in Slack. Perhaps we will meet up to work on a project together
but if we do the outcome of that meeting will be put into Slack for others who couldn't make it. We are not alienating people.
